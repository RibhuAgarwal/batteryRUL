ðŸ”‹ Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction



ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries based on cycling features engineered from experimental data.
It uses machine learning models to understand battery degradation patterns and estimate how many cycles a battery can last.
